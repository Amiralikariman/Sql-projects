My sql projects 
Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL, and other data analytics courses. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Tableau. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

Highlighted Projects

Spotify Top Songs Analaysis - SQL: In this project, I used a dataset found on Kaggle to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021. Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.
Predictive Book Ratings Analysis - SQL: In this project, I used my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads. I categorized the books by genre and obtained the average difference in rating per genre. I created another table containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict, for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.


World Happiness Rankings Dashboard - Tableau

Data: World Happiness Report
Audience: Anyone interested in geography & culture
Purpose: Explore and interact with visualized world happiness data
The World Happiness Report dataset ranks the happiness of 155 countries from 2015 to 2019. For this dashboard, I wanted the audience to be able to dive deeper into countries around the world and gain a contextual understanding of where those countries rank against the world average. The dashboard allows the user to explore the world map and compare metrics across countries. I'm endlessly interested in world geography and cultural nuances, so I created a dashboard that gets right to the information points I would most want to play with.
